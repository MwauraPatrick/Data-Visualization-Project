		Understanding vendor performance, reliability, and lead times is crucial for
		supply chain optimization.</p> <ul>2. Production Plant Activities</ul> <p>Insights into production processes, capacity utilisation, and bottlenecks
		are essential. We’ll analyse production efficiency, quality control, and
		resource allocation.</p> <ul>3. Distribution Data</ul> <p>Tracking distribution channels, transportation modes, and delivery times
		helps identify areas for improvement. Efficient logistics play a vital role
		in supply chain optimization.</p> <ul>4. Customer Data</ul> <p>Understanding customer demand patterns, preferences, and feedback informs
		inventory management and production planning.</p> <ul>5. Guiding Questions</ul> <p>By addressing these questions, we aim to enhance Suncharge’s supply chain
		efficiency and overall performance.</p> <ul><li>How can we increase efficiency?</li> <li>How can we increase efficiency?</li> <li>Are there production bottlenecks?</li> <li>Can we optimise transportation routes?</li> <li>How do we make insights detectable through a dashboard?</li> <li>What metrics should be displayed?</li> <li>How can we ensure actionable insights?</li> <li>How can this information drive decision-making?</li> <li>Can we reduce lead times?</li> <li>Should we adjust production schedules based on demand fluctuations?</li></ul> <p>We’ll explore bottlenecks, delays, and inefficiencies at each stage of the
