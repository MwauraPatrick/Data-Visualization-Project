		The Supply Chain Monitoring System project focuses on optimising the supply
		chain for Suncharge, a company that produces batteries for car and home
		electrical needs. By leveraging collected data, we aim to monitor the supply
		chain and gain insights for developing effective strategies for enhancing
		efficiency.
	</p>
	<pre>Key Features</pre>
	<li>1. Vendor Information</li>
	<p>
		The data includes details about both external and internal vendors.
		Understanding vendor performance, reliability, and lead times is crucial for
		supply chain optimization.
	</p>

	<li>2. Production Plant Activities</li>
	<p>
		Insights into production processes, capacity utilisation, and bottlenecks
		are essential. We’ll analyse production efficiency, quality control, and
		resource allocation.
	</p>

	<li>3. Distribution Data</li>

	<p>
		Tracking distribution channels, transportation modes, and delivery times
		helps identify areas for improvement. Efficient logistics play a vital role
		in supply chain optimization.
	</p>

	<li>4. Customer Data</li>
	<p>
		Understanding customer demand patterns, preferences, and feedback informs
		inventory management and production planning.
	</p>

	<li>5. Guiding Questions</li>
	<p>
		By addressing these questions, we aim to enhance Suncharge’s supply chain
		efficiency and overall performance.
	</p>

		<li>How can we increase efficiency?</li>
		<li>Are there production bottlenecks?</li>
		<li>Can we optimise transportation routes?</li>
		<li>How do we make insights detectable through a dashboard?</li>
		<li>What metrics should be displayed?</li>
		<li>How can we ensure actionable insights?</li>
		<li>How can this information drive decision-making?</li>
		<li>Can we reduce lead times?</li>
		<li>Should we adjust production schedules based on demand fluctuations?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We’ll explore bottlenecks, delays, and inefficiencies at each stage of the
		supply chain. Creating a user-friendly dashboard with real-time data
		visualisation in mind.
