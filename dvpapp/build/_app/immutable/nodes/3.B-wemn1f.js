		Understanding vendor performance, reliability, and lead times is crucial for
		supply chain optimization.</p> <ul>2. Production Plant Activities</ul> <p>Insights into production processes, capacity utilisation, and bottlenecks
		are essential. We’ll analyse production efficiency, quality control, and
		resource allocation.</p> <ul>3. Distribution Data</ul> <p>Tracking distribution channels, transportation modes, and delivery times
		helps identify areas for improvement. Efficient logistics play a vital role
		in supply chain optimization.</p> <ul>4. Customer Data</ul> <p>Understanding customer demand patterns, preferences, and feedback informs
		inventory management and production planning.</p> <ul>5. Guiding Questions</ul> <p>By addressing these questions, we aim to enhance Suncharge’s supply chain
